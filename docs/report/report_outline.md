# Report Outline (Markdown)

## Title Page
AI-Based Traffic Flow Estimator & Smart Signal Controller

## Abstract
Brief overview of problem, approach, and results (6–8 sentences).

## 1. Introduction & Motivation
Urban congestion, emissions, under-utilized CCTVs; goal of real-time metrics.

## 2. Related Work
Summarize 3–5 works; methods and limitations.

## 3. System Architecture
Block diagram: Camera → YOLO → Tracker → Metrics → Controller → Arduino LEDs.

## 4. Dataset & Pre-processing
Frame sampling, annotation policy, splits, class distribution.

## 5. Detection & Tracking
YOLO overview; configuration left to AI lead.

## 6. Metrics & Control
Queue length, density; adaptive green extension logic.

## 7. Results & Discussion
Accuracy, latency, demo screenshots.

## 8. Privacy & Ethics
PII avoidance; transmit only metrics.

## 9. Conclusion & Future Work
